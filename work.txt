For your Django-based resume screening application, you don't need to become an NLP expert, 
but a practical understanding of key NLP concepts will make your project more efficient.
 Here's a breakdown of how much to learn:

1. Essential NLP Basics (Must-Have)
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, lemmatization.

Regex & Pattern Matching: Extract key sections from resumes.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identify names, skills, job titles (spaCy is great for this).

TF-IDF or Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT): Useful for comparing resumes and ranking candidates.

2. Intermediate NLP (Useful for Optimization)
Fine-Tuning Pretrained Models: Train BERT or spaCy models for resume classification.

Sentence Embeddings: Use models like SBERT to compare resumes more effectively.

ML-Based Resume Scoring: Build simple scikit-learn models for ranking based on extracted data.

3. Advanced NLP (Nice-to-Have for Future Growth)
Conversational AI: If you want to integrate chat-based interactions for screening.

Automated Resume Summarization: Extract key achievements dynamically using NLP techniques.

If youâ€™re aiming for a functional prototype, focus mostly on the essentials and add intermediate 
concepts as needed.

Great! Now that you have extracted text and images, here are the next logical steps for your automated 
resume screening system:
Phase 1: Text Processing & Information Extraction
1. Parse Resume Sections
pythondef parse_resume_sections(text):
    # Identify sections like:
    # - Personal Information (name, email, phone)
    # - Experience/Work History
    # - Education
    # - Skills
    # - Certifications
    # - Projects
2. Extract Key Information

Personal Details: Name, email, phone, location
Work Experience: Company names, job titles, dates, descriptions
Education: Degrees, institutions, graduation dates, GPA
Skills: Technical skills, programming languages, tools
Keywords: Industry-specific terms

Phase 2: Analysis & Scoring
3. Skill Matching
pythondef match_skills(resume_skills, job_requirements):
    # Match candidate skills against job requirements
    # Calculate skill match percentage
4. Experience Analysis

Years of experience calculation
Industry relevance scoring
Job title relevance
Career progression analysis

5. Education Scoring

Degree relevance
Institution ranking (if applicable)
GPA consideration

Phase 3: Advanced Features
6. Keyword Density Analysis

ATS-friendly keyword matching
Industry buzzword detection

7. Image Processing (for your extracted images)

Profile photo analysis (if needed)
Chart/graph text extraction (OCR)
Logo recognition for company verification

Phase 4: Scoring & Ranking
8. Create Scoring Algorithm
pythondef calculate_resume_score(candidate_data, job_criteria):
    # Weighted scoring based on:
    # - Skill match (40%)
    # - Experience relevance (30%)
    # - Education (20%)
    # - Other factors (10%)
9. Generate Reports

Individual candidate analysis
Ranking of all candidates
Match percentage with reasoning
